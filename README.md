# repro_mit_20200123
This repo is for teaching a workshop on computationally reproducible research at MIT on January 23, 2020. Examples in this repo are using R as a tool. 


This is a practice project using the EDGAR CO2 emissions data from 1970 – 2018. 



## The Dataset
The dataset EDGAR CO2 emissions data from 1970 – 2018 is downloaded from the GitHub repository at <https://github.com/openclimatedata/edgar-co2-emissions> on January 23, 2020. 

The dataset is timeseries 1970–2018 of CO₂ emissions by country and sector (Buildings, Power Industry, Transport, Other industrial combustion, Other sectors) in Mt CO₂/year.

Unit: Mt CO₂ per year

Dataset © European Union, 1995-2020.<https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/licence/com_reuse> Authorized reuse with the source acknolwedged as below.

## Run this Project in the cloud
To run this code without installing anything, click on the launch binder badge above. This will launch Rstudio on a free, small, cloud instance. It may take a two or three minutes to launch the server and initialise Rstudio. 

Once the browder tab with the RStudio running in it opens up, you can find the file under *code* folder named *CO2EmissionsAnalysis.Rmd* in the Files tab of the bottom and right pane. Open the file by clicking on it. Then, click the Knit button just above the code to generate the report CO2EmissionAnalysis.html.
