# repro_mit
This repo is for teaching a workshop on computationally reproducible research at MIT. Examples in this repo are using R as a tool. 


This is a practice project using the EDGAR CO2 emissions data from 1970 – 2018. 



## The Dataset
The dataset EDGAR CO2 emissions data from 1970 – 2018 is downloaded from the GitHub repository at <https://github.com/openclimatedata/edgar-co2-emissions> on January 23, 2020. 

The dataset is timeseries 1970–2018 of CO₂ emissions by country and sector (Buildings, Power Industry, Transport, Other industrial combustion, Other sectors) in Mt CO₂/year.

Unit: Mt CO₂ per year

Dataset © European Union, 1995-2020.<https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/licence/com_reuse> Authorized reuse with the source acknolwedged as below.

## Run this Project in the cloud
To run this code without installing anything, choose one of the following two means. 

1. Run another copy of it on the interactive environment Renku at <https://renkulab.io/projects/yel/reproducibility-mit-20220127/sessions>. Click on starting a *New* environment there.   

2. Click on the launch binder badge above. This will launch Rstudio on a free, small, cloud instance on binder.org. It may take a two or three minutes to launch the server and initialise Rstudio. 

Once the browder tab with the RStudio running in it opens up, you can find the file under *code* folder named *CO2EmissionsAnalysis.Rmd* in the Files tab of the bottom and right pane. Open the file by clicking on it. Then, click the Knit button just above the code to generate the report CO2EmissionAnalysis.html. You may also generate the report by typing source('run.r') into the left bottom Console and hit return key. This will generate the report in HTML and saved under documents folder.
